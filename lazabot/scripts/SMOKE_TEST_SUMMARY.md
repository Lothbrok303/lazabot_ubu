# Lazabot Smoke Test Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully created a comprehensive smoke test system for the Lazabot CLI application that validates the complete pipeline from product monitoring to checkout completion.

## What Was Created

### 1. Smoke Test Scripts

#### `scripts/smoke_test.sh` - Main Smoke Test
- **Purpose**: Validates the complete Lazabot pipeline
- **Features**:
  - Starts mock Lazada API server
  - Builds and runs lazabot in monitor mode
  - Simulates checkout process
  - Generates comprehensive test report
  - Verifies database storage

#### `scripts/run_smoke_test.sh` - Comprehensive Test Suite
- **Purpose**: Advanced test suite with integration tests
- **Features**:
  - Mock server setup and management
  - Integration tests with database verification
  - CLI smoke tests
  - Detailed reporting and logging
  - Performance monitoring

### 2. Mock Lazada API Server

#### `mock_server.js` - Express.js Mock Server
- **Port**: 3001
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /health` - Health check
  - `GET /api/products/:id` - Product details
  - `POST /api/cart/add` - Add to cart
  - `POST /api/checkout` - Complete checkout

#### Key Features:
- **Flash Sale Simulation**: Product becomes available after 5 seconds
- **Price Reduction**: $100.00 → $50.00 during flash sale
- **Stock Management**: Starts with 0 stock, becomes available with 10 units
- **Order Generation**: Creates unique order IDs and cart IDs

### 3. Test Products Configuration

#### `test_products.yaml` - Test Product Definition
```yaml
products:
  - id: "smoke-test-product"
    name: "Smoke Test Product"
    url: "http://localhost:3001/api/products/smoke-test-product"
    target_price: 80.00
    min_stock: 1
    monitor_interval_ms: 1000
```

### 4. Integration Tests

#### `tests/smoke_test_integration.rs` - Rust Integration Tests
- **Database Integration**: Tests SQLite storage
- **API Connectivity**: Validates mock server communication
- **Pipeline Validation**: End-to-end workflow testing
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenarios

### 5. Documentation

#### `scripts/README_smoke_test.md` - Comprehensive Documentation
- **Usage Instructions**: How to run the tests
- **Test Components**: Detailed explanation of each component
- **Expected Output**: What to expect from successful runs
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
- **CI/CD Integration**: How to integrate with continuous integration

## Test Pipeline Flow

### 1. Setup Phase
1. **Prerequisites Check**: Verifies Rust, Node.js, and project structure
2. **Build Process**: Compiles lazabot binary
3. **Mock Server Creation**: Generates Express.js mock server
4. **Dependencies Installation**: Installs Node.js packages

### 2. Execution Phase
1. **Mock Server Startup**: Starts API server on port 3001
2. **Product Monitoring**: Lazabot monitors test product
3. **Flash Sale Detection**: Detects when product becomes available
4. **Checkout Simulation**: Simulates adding to cart and checkout
5. **Database Storage**: Verifies order storage in SQLite

### 3. Verification Phase
1. **Log Analysis**: Checks for success indicators in logs
2. **Database Verification**: Confirms order was stored
3. **Report Generation**: Creates comprehensive test report
4. **Cleanup**: Stops servers and cleans up resources

## Expected Output

### Successful Test Run

## Key Success Indicators

- ✅ Mock server is running and healthy
- ✅ Product availability detected
- ✅ Flash sale triggered successfully
- ✅ Checkout process completed
- ✅ Order stored in database
- ✅ Integration tests passed

## Files Generated

### Test Results
- `smoke_test_results/` - Test results directory
- `mock_server.js` - Mock API server
- `test_products.yaml` - Test configuration
- `smoke_test.db` - SQLite database with test data
- `smoke_test_report.md` - Comprehensive test report

### Log Files
- `monitor.log` - Product monitoring logs
- `integration_test.log` - Integration test logs
- `mock_server.log` - Mock server logs
- `smoke_test.log` - Test execution logs

## Usage Instructions

### Basic Smoke Test
```bash
cd lazabot
./scripts/smoke_test.sh
```

### Comprehensive Test Suite
```bash
cd lazabot
./scripts/run_smoke_test.sh
```

### Manual Verification
```bash
# Check if database was created
ls -la scripts/smoke_test.db

# Query the database (if sqlite3 is installed)
sqlite3 scripts/smoke_test.db "SELECT * FROM orders;"

# View test report
cat scripts/smoke_test_report.md
```

## Integration with CI/CD

The smoke tests can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run Smoke Tests
  run: |
    cd lazabot
    ./scripts/run_smoke_test.sh
    
- name: Upload Test Results
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: smoke-test-results
    path: lazabot/scripts/smoke_test_results/
```

## Next Steps

1. **Real API Integration**: Test with actual Lazada API endpoints
2. **Performance Testing**: Add load testing and benchmarks
3. **Error Handling**: Test various failure scenarios
4. **Security Testing**: Validate security measures
5. **End-to-End Testing**: Complete browser automation tests

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**: Check Rust installation and dependencies
2. **Mock Server Issues**: Verify Node.js installation and port availability
3. **Database Issues**: Check SQLite installation and file permissions
4. **Network Issues**: Ensure localhost connectivity

### Debug Mode
```bash
export LAZABOT_LOG_LEVEL=debug
./scripts/smoke_test.sh
```

## Conclusion

The smoke test system provides a comprehensive validation framework for the Lazabot CLI application. It demonstrates the complete pipeline from product monitoring to checkout completion, ensuring that all core functionality works as expected. The system is designed to be easily integrated into CI/CD pipelines and provides detailed reporting for debugging and verification purposes.

The implementation includes:
- ✅ Mock Lazada API server
- ✅ Product monitoring simulation
- ✅ Flash sale detection
- ✅ Checkout process simulation
- ✅ Database storage verification
- ✅ Comprehensive reporting
- ✅ Integration tests
- ✅ Documentation and troubleshooting guides

This smoke test system validates that the core pipeline works correctly and provides a foundation for more comprehensive testing as the application evolves.
